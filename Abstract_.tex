This study aimed on the assessment of displayed emotions and jokes in the movie
"Forrest Gumpâ€œ. Each scene was analysed in randomized order, whereas one part
of the raters used the audio-visual, the other the audio version of the movie
in German language. Emotions have been annotated in regard to their temporal
occurrence, valence, direction, arousal as well as onset and offset cues.
Additionally, emotion labels could be assigned. Jokes were notated with their
temporal occurrence. The annotations have been analysed on conformity.
