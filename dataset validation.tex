\textit{This is currently just a dump of some descriptive statistics.}

Annotations for a total of \AVTotalCharLabels\ and \AOTotalCharLabels\
different characters were created for the audio-visual movie (AV) and the audio
movie (AO) respectively. There are \AVThreshCharLabels~(AV) and
\AOThreshCharLabels~(AO) characters for which there is a \AVAggThresh\ minimum
inter-rater agreement on the presence of a portrayed emotion for at least five
episodes of one second or longer throughout the entire movie. The number of
emotion episodes for for these characters is shown in figure \ref{fig:threshchar}.
As expected, the majority of all portrayed emotions are associated with the main
movie characters Forrest, Dan, and Jenny.

    more episodes of portrayed emotions are shown. All considered episodes for a particular character
    show a minimum inter-rater agreement of \AVAggThresh\ with respect to their
    presence at a particular time in the movie, not necessarily in terms of the
    nature of the emotion. (A) Number of episodes
    per character for both movie variants. (B) Total duration of emotion display
    across all considered episodes.}

For the audio movie \AOFracWithLabeledEmotions\ of all annotations include at
least one of the 22 explicit emotion label (see table
\ref{tab:emotion_categories}, whereas only \AVFracWithLabeledEmotions\ of
annotations for the audio-visual movie contain such a label. This is an
indication that emotion cues in the visual movie more diverse and ambiguous in
comparison to the audio-only stimulus. Figure \ref{fig:threshlabeledemotion}
shows the frequency of individual emotion. For both stimulus types the majority
of all emotional episodes involve the five categories anger/rage, fear,
happiness, love and sadness.

  \caption{Episodes of portrayed emotion by category. Only observations assigning
    one of the 22 emotion labels were considered, and only emotion categories
    with five or more episodes are shown. All considered episodes for a particular emotion

    presence at a particular time in the movie, not necessarily in terms of the
    portraying character. (A) Number of episodes

Almost all annotations (AO: \AOFracWithLabeledOncue; AV:
\AVFracWithLabeledOncue) include information on the nature of the cue(s)
indicating the onset or presence of an emotion. Only considering annotations
with a minimum inter-rater agreement of \AVAggThresh\ with respect to the type
of onset cue, the two dominating emotion cues are mimic/facial expressions
(only for the audio-visual movie) and verbal cues (for both stimulus types)
Figure \ref{fig:threshlabeledoncue} shows the frequency of individual emotion
onset cues for all six distinguished cue types.

  \caption{Observation consistency estimates. All values are Pearson
    correlation coefficients for \unit[1]{Hz} modulations of the fraction of
    inter-observer agreement (as, for example, depicted in figure
    \ref{fig:indicatortsallchar}) with respect to a particular emotion
    attribute across the entire duration of the movie. The specified range
    corresponds to the width of the 95\% confidence interval of the estimate
    (mean value or correlation coefficient via Fisher transformation).
    The \textit{all characters} column indicates the agreement for a particular
    emotion attribute over time irrespective of the annotated character. The
    columns on the right show the corresponding correlations for the two main
    characters. \textit{Intra-stimulus inter-observer consistency} refers to
    the mean correlation of agreement time courses for all possible
    combinations of partitioning observers into two sub-groups (audio-visual
    4~vs.~5; audio-only 1~vs~2). Higher correlations indicate higher consistency
    of aggreement modulations across observer sub-groups. \textit{Intra-stimulus
    indicator correlation} refers to the correlation of agreement modulations
    across the full set of observers for two different emotion attributes.
    \textit{Inter-stimulus indicator correlation} indicates the consistency
    between agreement modulations across movie types (audio-visual; audio-only)
  and, consequently, across independent groups of observers. }
